# ShopEase Development Plan

## **Phase 1: Define and Plan (1-2 Weeks)**

### **Step 1: Clarify Your Vision**
- **Mission Statement:**  
  *“ShopEase makes online shopping smarter, faster, and more personalized by providing tailored recommendations and the best deals.”*
  
- **Unique Selling Points:**  
  - Personalized product recommendations based on user profiles.
  - Automatic coupon application and price comparisons.
  - Cross-platform shopping aggregation.

---

### **Step 2: Identify Target Users**
- **Who are you building for?**
  - Busy professionals looking for convenience.
  - Budget-conscious students.
  - Gift shoppers who need inspiration.

- **Pain Points:**  
  - Wasting time browsing multiple sites.
  - Missing deals or discounts.
  - Not knowing what to buy.

---

### **Step 3: Sketch the Product Flow**
- Create a **flow diagram** (e.g., draw on paper or use tools like Lucidchart):
  1. Users log in and create profiles.
  2. Input preferences (e.g., favorite categories, past purchases).
  3. Browse and search for products.
  4. Get personalized recommendations and deals.
  5. Add items to a cart aggregated across platforms.

---

## **Phase 2: Build a Prototype (2-3 Months)**

### **Step 1: Learn the Basics**
- **Frontend (User Interface):**
  - Learn **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create a basic website.
  - Use frameworks like **React.js** for dynamic user interfaces.

- **Backend (Logic and Storage):**
  - Learn **Python** for server-side development (or another backend language like Node.js).
  - Learn **Flask** or **Django** to handle user requests and build APIs.

- **Databases:**
  - Learn SQL (e.g., **PostgreSQL**) to store user profiles, preferences, and product data.
  - Alternatively, explore NoSQL (e.g., **MongoDB**) for more flexibility.

---

### **Step 2: Create a Simple Website**
- Start with a single-page website:
  - A **search bar** for products.
  - Basic user authentication (login/signup).

- Tools:
  - **HTML/CSS** for static pages.
  - **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind CSS** for quick styling.

---

### **Step 3: Fetch Product Data**
- **Use APIs**:
  - Look into APIs like:
    - **Amazon Product Advertising API**
    - **Walmart Open API**
    - **eBay Finding API**

- **Web Scraping (if APIs aren’t available):**
  - Use Python libraries like **BeautifulSoup** or **Selenium**.
  - **Important:** Ensure compliance with the terms of use of the websites you scrape.

---

### **Step 4: Build the Personalization Engine**
- **Start Simple**:
  - Use **rules-based recommendations**, such as:
    - Popular products in a category.
    - Products similar to recent searches.

- **Save Data:**
  - Store user preferences in a database table:
    ```plaintext
    User Table:
    - user_id
    - name
    - preferences (categories, budget, etc.)
    - browsing history
    ```

---

## **Phase 3: Test and Iterate (1-2 Months)**

### **Step 1: Get Feedback on the Prototype**
- **Test with Friends/Family:**
  - Ask them to search for products and check if the recommendations are useful.
- **Track Key Metrics:**
  - How long does it take users to find what they want?
  - Do users feel the recommendations are relevant?

---

### **Step 2: Collect Real Data**
- If possible, **deploy the website** (use platforms like **Heroku**, **Netlify**, or **AWS**).
- Begin collecting user data:
  - Browsing history, product clicks, and purchase patterns.

---

## **Phase 4: Implement AI for Advanced Personalization (3-6 Months)**

### **Step 1: Train a Machine Learning Model**
- **Collect Training Data:**
  - Gather data on users’ preferences, clicks, and purchases.

- **Build Recommendation Algorithms:**
  - **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommend products based on other users with similar preferences.
  - **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommend products based on attributes (e.g., price, category).

- **Tools:**
  - Use Python libraries like **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, or **PyTorch**.

---

### **Step 2: Automate Coupon Searches**
- Integrate with coupon APIs (e.g., **Honey** or custom solutions).
- Use web scraping tools like **Playwright** for finding coupons dynamically.

---

### **Step 3: Scale Your Infrastructure**
- Optimize database queries for faster recommendations.
- Use caching (e.g., **Redis**) to store frequently used data.

---

## **Phase 5: Launch and Scale (Ongoing)**

### **Step 1: Launch Public Beta**
- Launch the site for a small audience (friends, colleagues, or on social media).
- Collect feedback to improve user experience.

---

### **Step 2: Add Features Based on Feedback**
- Example features:
  - More robust filters (price, brand, etc.).
  - A “gift finder” tool for personalized gift recommendations.

---

### **Step 3: Scale the System**
- **Increase Performance:**
  - Move to scalable cloud platforms like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **Azure**.
- **Marketing:**
  - Promote through social media, blogs, or partnerships with online retailers.
